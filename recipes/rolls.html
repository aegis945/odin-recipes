        <li>1/2 c.sour cream</li>
        <li> 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract </li>

        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small sauce pan over medium heat, combine strawberries, water, and
            sugar. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Stirring frequently,
            cook until thick and jammy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine cream cheese with sugar, sour cream, vanilla,
            and kosher salt. Using a hand mixer, beat ingredients until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape and spoon approximately
            3 tablespoons cream cheese mixture into a line in the center. Fold up bottom half and
            tightly fold in sides. Gently roll, then seal fold with a couple drops of water.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil (it should reach 1" up the
            side of pan) until it starts to bubble. Add egg rolls and fry until
            golden, 1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly. </li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and serve with strawberry sauce. </li>
    </ol>
